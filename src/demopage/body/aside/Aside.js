            <p>Many restaurants will run events throughout the week - like
                Happy Hours - to keep customers coming back at specific, perhaps low traffic, times. This is great
                content to add to your website to make sure new guests know about the unique things happening at your
                establishment. Olympia Oyster Bar in Portland, OR has an Upcoming Events section up top, and if you
                scroll down, you'll find their Weekly Happenings section, as well as more
                info about their events. </p>
